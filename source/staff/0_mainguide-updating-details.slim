      h1 Introducing the help with fees service  

      p The help with fees service used to be known as ‘fee remission’.

      p As you process an application for help with fees, you'll see prompts and explanations on the right hand side of the screen. You can also return to this page if you need more help.  

      p The service has a link to the Department for Work and Pensions so can check whether applicants are receiving benefits. 

      p When you’ve entered all the information from the form you’ll get a result about whether the applicant is eligible for help with fees.
