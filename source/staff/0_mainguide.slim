      h3 Introduction

      p As you process an application for help with fees, you'll see prompts and explanations on the right hand side of the screen. You can also return to this page if you need more help.  

      p The service has a link to the Department for Work and Pensions so can check whether applicants are receiving benefits. 

      p When you’ve entered all the information from the form you’ll get a result about whether the applicant is eligible for help with fees. 
      
      br
      h3 Who can apply for help with fees? 
      p Individuals can apply for financial help with their court or tribunal fees if they: 
      ul  
        li only have a small amount of savings and investments 
        li and receive certain benefits
        li or are on a low income 
      br
      p See the 'Before you start' checklist for details of people who are not eligible to apply for help. 

      br
      h3 Before you start
      
      h5 Check the statement of truth has been signed
      p Unsigned forms must be returned to the applicant
      
      br
      h5 Check the applicant is not one of the following: 
      ul
        li on the list of <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious-litigants" target="_blank"> vexatious litigants</a> banned from starting court proceedings without permission
        li bound by a <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/general-civil-restraint-orders-in-force" target="_blank"> general civil restraint order (CRO)</a> to stop them from bringing certain cases to court
        li bound by an <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/extended-civil-restraint-orders-in-force" target="_blank"> extended civil restraint order (CRO)</a> to stop them making applications in certain courts or make further court claims
        li bound by a <a href="#">restrictions of proceedings order (RPO)</a></li> that limits the cases that can be brought by the applicant 
      
      br
      h5 Check the applicant is not receving Legal Aid 
      ul
        li applicants with legal representation under a no-win, no-fee agreement or legal expenses scheme are eligible to apply 
        li applicants receiving 'help at court' and 'legal help' are eligible to apply 
        li applicants receiving Scottish Legal Aid are only eligible to apply for help with their fees if they're applying to the Employment Tribunal and Employment Appeal Tribunal
        li applicants who have legal representation or 'family help' (Higher) are not eligible to apply for help with fees. The representing solicitor will pay the fee and apply for a refund from the Legal Aid Agency. 
        li applicants applying for a Consent Order who are receiving advice under 'family help' (Lower) are not eligible to apply for help with fees. The representing solicitor will pay the fee and apply for a refund from the Legal Aid Agency.
        li applicants receiving Northern Irish Legal Aid are not eligible to apply 
      
      br
      h5 Check the applicant is not a company, charity or not for profit organisation 
      ul
        li except for companies applying to the Gambling Appeals Tribunal) see more about <a href="#">exceptions for companies </a>
        li except for charities and not for profit organisations making a case to the UK Supreme Court)see more about <a href="#">exceptions for charities and non-profit organisations</a>
      
      br
      h5 Check the case or claim is not one of these:  
      ul
        li a money claim online (MCOL) or possession claim online (PCOL) (including refunds)
        li a request for duplicate documents or search fees (unless the applicant did not receive the originals or had no fixed address when an order was made)
      
      br
      h3 People applying from outside the UK
      p You can accept applications from people living outside the UK if their case is being dealt with by a court or tribunal in the UK. 

      p You can still accept an application from someone who has ‘no recourse to public funds’ specified on their visa. They will be assessed in the same way as any other foreign national or non-resident UK citizen. 

      p Make sure the application uses UK pounds sterling for details of income. 

      br
      h3 National Insurance number 
      p If the applicant has answered ‘Yes’ to question 9, but has not provided their NI number in question 1, contact them by phone to ask for it.

      br
      h3 Status
      p Applicants should be considered 'single' if they have a partner with a contrary interest in the case for which they're seeking help with their fee. Contrary interests can include: 
      ul
        li divorce, dissolution or annulment*
        li gender recognition applications
        li domestic violence
        li forced marriages 
        li where a couple are both part of a 'multiple fee' group.
      br
      p * If an applicant is involved in a divorce, dissolution or annulment case they should be considered to be part of a couple if they've formed a new relationship where they're living together and sharing a joint income. 

      p Applicants should be considered to be married or living with someone and sharing an income even if they're not currently living at the same address. For example if one or both are: 
      ul 
        li serving in the Armed forces
        li are in prison
        li living in residential care
      
      br
      br 
      h3 Refunds 
      p For refunds check the: 
      ul
        li fee was paid within the last 3 months on the fee sheet 
        li case management system to ensure the payment hasn’t already been refunded
        br
      p If the fee was paid more than 3 months ago, your delivery manager may be able to extend the period of 3 months if they think there's good reason to do so.  
      br 
      h3 id="emergency" Emergency cases
      p An emergency case is one where delay may harm the applicant or the applicant’s case, for example: 
      ul
        li suspending an eviction
        li debtor insolvency petition
        li children or vulnerable adults
        li domestic violence
        li injunctions
        li ‘out of hours’ provisions at the Royal Courts of Justice
        br
      p Because the 'help with fees' processing tool provides you with an instant result, most emergency applications can be processed straight away.   

      p However, if an application can't be processed before the emergency application is heard, the applicant or their legal representative will need to give an undertaking to file an EX160 or pay the relevant fee within 7 days.  
      
      br
      h3 id="savings" Savings and investments
      p The maximum amount of savings and investments allowed for each applicant is calculated for you. This is based on the fee and the age of the applicant (and that of their partner if they have one). 

      p The table below is for your reference. It shows the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed for applicants under 61.

        li When you’ve entered the total monthly income you’ll see whether the applicant is eligible for help.
