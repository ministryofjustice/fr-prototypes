      h3 id="intro" Introduction

      p You only need to check paper evidence when an application is marked for an evidence check. The statement of truth signed by the applicant is legally binding.
      p See more about <a href='#'> what to do if you suspect fraud </a>
      p Evidence checks are a way for HMCTS to make sure that applicants are providing accurate information about their income. 
      p If an application is marked for an evidence check, write to the applicant and ask them to send evidence of their income. You’ll be provided with a letter to use.  
      br

      h3 id="before-start" Before you start
      h5 When you receive the evidence: 
      ul 
        li check the name on the evidence matches the name on the application
        li check the evidence is dated within 3 months of receiving the application
        li for refunds the evidence must cover the date the fee was paid (can be up to 3 months before the fee was paid) 
      br

      h3 id="Problems with the evidence" Problems with the evidence 
      br You may not be able to process the evidence provided by an applicant. Common problems are: 
      ol 
        li the name on the evidence doesn't match the name of the applicant
        li the evidence is out of date 
        li the applicant has not provided all evidence required 
      p In all of these cases, you should return the evidence to the applicant and tell them why it can't be accepted. If they still require help with fees they'll need to apply again.  
      p If a couple is receiving a shared benefit but the benefits letter doesn't state the applicant’s name the applicant must provide additional evidence to show they live at the same address as their partner. 
      p A letter will be generated for you to send to the applicant along with the evidence.
