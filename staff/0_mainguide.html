The service has a link to the Department for Work and Pensions so can check whether applicants are receiving benefits.  </br><br>When you’ve entered all the information from the form you’ll get a result about whether the applicant is eligible for help with fees. </br><br>You’ll also be prompted to send a letter requesting further information or part-payment if the applicant hasn’t fully completed the form, or is eligible to pay part of the fee. </br><h5>Evidence </h5><br>In most cases you won’t need to check paper evidence (eg bank statements and payslips). However, some applications are chosen to have evidence checked. When this happens, you’ll be prompted to write to the applicant asking to see evidence of their income. A letter will be generated for you to use. </br><br>Applications will move to ‘Applications waiting for evidence’ until you receive the evidence. </br><h5>Setting up your account </h5><br>You’ll need to be set up with an account to process help with fees applications using the online tool at: URL HERE</br><br>Your team manager is usually responsible for setting up your account.  </br><br>You’ll receive an email with a link to set up your password.
