You can also return to this page if you need more help.  </p><p>The service has a link to the Department for Work and Pensions so can check whether applicants are receiving benefits. </p><p>When you’ve entered all the information from the form you’ll get a result about whether the applicant is eligible for help with fees. </p><br /><h3>Who can apply for help with fees? </h3><p>Individuals can apply for financial help with their court or tribunal fees if they: </p><ul><li>only have a small amount of savings and investments </li><li>and receive certain benefits</li><li>or are on a low income </li></ul><br /><p>See the 'Before you start' checklist for details of people who are not eligible to apply for help. </p><br /><h3>Before you start</h3><p>Check the statement of truth has been signed</p><p>Unsigned forms must be returned to the applicant</p><p>Check the applicant is not one of the following: </p><ul><li>on the list of <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/vexatious-litigants" target="_blank"> vexatious litigants</a> banned from starting court proceedings without permission</li><li>bound by a <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/general-civil-restraint-orders-in-force" target="_blank"> general civil restraint order (CRO)</a> to stop them from bringing certain cases to court</li><li>bound by an <a href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/extended-civil-restraint-orders-in-force" target="_blank"> extended civil restraint order (CRO)</a> to stop them making applications in certain courts or make further court claims</li><li>bound by a <a href="#">restrictions of proceedings order (RPO)</a></li> that limits the cases that can be brought by the applicant </li></ul><p>Check the applicant is not receving Legal Aid </p><ul><li>applicants with legal representation under a no-win, no-fee agreement or legal expenses scheme are eligible to apply </li><li>applicants receiving 'help at court' and 'legal help' are eligible to apply </li><li>applicants receiving Scottish Legal Aid are only eligible to apply for help with their fees if they're applying to the Employment Tribunal and Employment Appeal Tribunal</li><li>applicants who have legal representation or 'family help' (Higher) are not eligible to apply for help with fees.

They will be assessed in the same way as any other foreign national or non-resident UK citizen. </p><p>Make sure the application uses UK pounds sterling for details of income. </p><br /><h3>National Insurance number </h3><p>If the applicant has answered ‘Yes’ to question 9, but has not provided their NI number in question 1, contact them by phone to ask for it.</p><br /><h3>Status</h3><p>Applicants should be considered 'single' if they have a partner with a contrary interest in the case for which they're seeking help with their fee. Contrary interests can include: </p><ul><li>divorce, dissolution or annulment*</li><li>gender recognition applications</li><li>domestic violence</li><li>forced marriages </li><li>where a couple are both part of a 'multiple fee' group.</li></ul><br /><p>* If an applicant is involved in a divorce, dissolution or annulment case they should be considered to be part of a couple if they've formed a new relationship where they're living together and sharing a joint income. </p><p>Applicants should be considered to be married or living with someone and sharing an income even if they're not currently living at the same address. For example if one or both are: </p><ul><li>serving in the Armed forces</li><li>are in prison</li><li>living in residential care</li></ul><br /><br /><h3>Refunds </h3><p>For refunds check the: </p><ul><li>fee was paid within the last 3 months on the fee sheet </li><li>case management system to ensure the payment hasn’t already been refunded</li><br /></ul><p>If the fee was paid more than 3 months ago, your delivery manager may be able to extend the period of 3 months if they think there's good reason to do so.  </p><br /><h3>Emergency cases</h3><p>An emergency case is one where delay may harm the applicant or the applicant’s case, for example: </p><ul><li>suspending an eviction</li><li>debtor insolvency petition</li><li>children or vulnerable adults</li><li>domestic violence</li><li>injunctions</li><li>‘out of hours’ provisions at the Royal Courts of Justice</li><br /></ul><p>Because the 'help with fees' processing tool provides you with an instant result, most emergency applications can be processed straight away.   </p><p>However, if an application can't be processed before the emergency application is heard, the applicant or their legal representative will need to give an undertaking to file an EX160 or pay the relevant fee within 7 days.  </p><br /><h3>Savings and investments</h3><p>The maximum amount of savings and investments allowed for each applicant is calculated for you. This is based on the fee and the age of the applicant (and that of their partner if they have one). </p><p>The table below is for your reference. It shows the maximum amount of savings and investments allowed for applicants under 61.</p><table><thead><tr><th>The court or tribunal fee is:</th><th>The applicant must have less than this amount in savings and investments:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Up to £1,000</td><td>£3,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £1,001 - £1,335</td><td>£4,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £1,336 - £1,665</td><td>£5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £1,666 - £2,000</td><td>£6,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £2,001 - £2,330</td><td>£7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £2,331 - £4,000</td><td>£8,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £4,001 - £5,000</td><td>£10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £5,001 - £6,000</td><td>£12,000</td></tr><tr><td>Between £6,001 - £7,000</td><td>£14,000</td></tr><tr><td>£7,001 or over</td><td>£16,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Applicants who are 61 or over (or who have a partner who is 61 or over) may have up to £16,000 in savings and investments. </p><br /><h3>Total monthly income</h3><ul><li>If the applicant is part of a couple they must have provided details of their partner’s income</li><li>Add the 2 monthly income amounts and enter the total </li><li>When you’ve entered the total monthly income you’ll see whether the applicant is eligible for help.</li><li>The calculation is based on the applicant’s income, whether there are any dependent children and if they’re part of a couple. </li></ul><br /><p>The tables below are for your reference: </p><table><thead><tr><th>Table 1</th><th>Single</th><th>Part of a couple</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Maximum income</td><td>£1,085 plus £245 for each child you have</td><td>£1,245 plus £245 for each child that you have </td></tr><tr><td>For example:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1 child</td><td>£1,330</td><td>£1,490</td></tr><tr><td>2 children</td><td>£1,575</td><td>£1,735</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If the applicant’s monthly income is:</p><ul><li>less than the amount in table 1 then they’ll be eligible for help with the fee </li><li>more than the amount in table 1, see table 2 below </li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Table 2</th><th>Single</th><th>Part of a couple</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Maximum income</td><td>£5,085 plus £245 for each child</td><td>£5,245 plus £245 for each child</td></tr><tr><td>For example:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1 child</td><td>£5,330</td><td>£5,490</td></tr><tr><td>2 children</td><td>£5,575</td><td>£5,735</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If the applicant’s monthly income is:</p><ul><li>less than the amount in table 2, they may be eligible for some money off the fee.
