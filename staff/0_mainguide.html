They will be assessed in the same way as any other foreign national or non-resident UK citizen. </p><p>Make sure the application uses UK pounds sterling for details of income. </p><h4>National Insurance number </h4><p>If the applicant has answered ‘Yes’ to question 9, but has not provided their NI number in question 1, contact them by phone to ask for it.</p><h4>Status</h4><p>Applicants should be considered 'single' if they have a partner with a contrary interest in the case for which they're seeking help with their fee. Contrary interests can include: </p><ul><li>divorce, dissolution or annulment*</li><li>gender recognition applications</li><li>domestic violence</li><li>forced marriages </li><li>where a couple are both part of a 'multiple fee' group.</li></ul><br /><p>* If an applicant is involved in a divorce, dissolution or annulment case they should be considered to be part of a couple if they've formed a new relationship where they're living together and sharing a joint income. </p><p>Applicants should be considered to be married or living with someone and sharing an income even if they're not currently living at the same address. For example if one or both are: </p><ul><li>serving in the Armed forces</li><li>are in prison</li><li>living in residential care</li></ul><br /><h4>Refunds </h4><p>For refunds check the: </p><ul><li>fee was paid within the last 3 months on the fee sheet </li><li>case management system to ensure the payment hasn’t already been refunded</li><br /></ul><p>If the fee was paid more than 3 months ago, your delivery manager may be able to extend the period of 3 months if they think there's good reason to do so.  </p><p></p><h4>Emergency cases</h4><p>An emergency case is one where delay may harm the applicant or the applicant’s case, for example: </p><ul><li>suspending an eviction</li><li>debtor insolvency petition</li><li>children or vulnerable adults</li><li>domestic violence</li><li>injunctions</li><li>‘out of hours’ provisions at the Royal Courts of Justice</li><br /></ul><p>Because the 'help with fees' processing tool provides you with an instant result, most emergency applications can be processed straight away.   </p><p>However, if an application can't be processed before the emergency application is heard, the applicant or their legal representative will need to give an undertaking to file an EX160 or pay the relevant fee within 7 days.  </p><br /><h4>Total monthly income</h4><ul><li>If the applicant is part of a couple they must have provided details of their partner’s income</li><li>Add the 2 monthly income amounts and enter the total </li></ul><br>Some benefits shouldn't be included as income, eg Carer's Allowance, Housing Benefit or childcare element of Working Tax Credit, see the full list of <a href='#'>excluded benefits</a>.  </br><footer class="row"><div class="large-6 columns"><p></p></div></footer><p></p><a href="/"></a></div></div><script src="../assets/javascripts/libs.js"></script><script src="../assets/javascripts/app.js"></script><script src="../assets/javascripts/details.polyfill.js"></script></body></html>
